The features with the best correlations could prove to be the most helpful for our Linear Regression model! Pandas DataFrames have a really helpful method, `.corr()`, that allows us to see the correlation coefficients for each pair of our different features. Remember, a correlation of `0` indicates that two features have no linear relationship, a correlation coefficient of `1` indicates two features have a perfect positive linear relationship, and a correlation coefficient of `-1` indicates two features have a perfect negative linear relationship. Call `.corr()` on `df`. You'll see that `number_funny_votes` has a correlation coefficient of `0.001320` with respect to `stars`, our Yelp rating. This is a very weak correlation.

VADER uses a labeled set of positive and negative words, along with codified rules of grammar, to estimate how positive or negative a statement is. Scores range from `-1`, most negative, to `+1`, most positive, with a score of `0` indicating a neutral statement. While not perfect, VADER does a good job at guessing the sentiment of text data!\n",
