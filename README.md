<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![alt text](https://github.com/amirap/Machine-Learning/blob/master/machineLearning3.png)

This repository contains source code to some mini Machine Learning (ML) projects. These are my pet projects to get hands-on experience in common ML algorithms. The projects and data come from different sources incl. codeacademy and Kaggle.    

## 02 ML_LinearRegression_TheFunction.ipynb
This code is for Linear Regression function. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) has ready-to-use Linear Regression models.   But in this code, I have wriiten Linear Regression function from scratch using Pyhton libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

You can access the code [here] (https://github.com/amirap/Machine-Learning/blob/master/02%20ML_LinearRegression_TheFunction.ipynb)
