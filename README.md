<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![alt text](https://github.com/amirap/Machine-Learning/blob/master/machineLearning3.png)

This repository contains source code to some mini Machine Learning (ML) projects. These are my pet projects to get hands-on experience in common ML algorithms. The projects and data come from different sources incl. codeacademy and Kaggle.    

<!-- 02 ML_LinearRegression_TheFunction -->
## 02 ML_LinearRegression_TheFunction
This code is for Linear Regression function. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) has ready-to-use Linear Regression modules and functions. But in this code, I have written the Linear Regression function from scratch using Pyhton libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

You can access the code [here](https://github.com/amirap/Machine-Learning/blob/master/02%20ML_LinearRegression_TheFunction.ipynb)

<!-- 03 ML_LinearRegression_PlayersHeightsWeights -->
## 03 ML_LinearRegression_PlayersHeightsWeights

In this project, we want fit a dataset of baseball players’ heights and weights into a Linear Regression model. We do NOT use Skikit-learn. Instead, we use the Linear Regression function that we wrote from sractch in other project (i.e.,02 ML_LinearRegression_TheFunction)

You can access the code [here](https://github.com/amirap/Machine-Learning/blob/master/02%20ML_LinearRegression_TheFunction.ipynb)

<!-- 04 ML_LinearRegression_KaggleChallengeHoneyProduction -->
## 04 ML_LinearRegression_KaggleChallengeHoneyProduction

In this project, we want to investigate a Kaggle dataset to explore the decline of honeybees population and how the trends of the past predict the future for the honeybees. We will use Skikit-learn. 

You can access the code [here](https://github.com/amirap/Machine-Learning/blob/master/04%20ML_LinearRegression_KaggleChallengeHoneyProduction.ipynb)

## 05 ML_MultipleLinearRegression_SteerteasyRentPrediction

In this project, we want to investigate a real dataset by StreetEasy, a New York City’s leading real estate marketplace. The dataset contains a sample of rentals listings in Manhattan, active on StreetEasy in June 2016. We would like to explore correlations between several features and the rent, build/evaluate.

Questions to answer: “Does having a washer/dryer in unit increase the price of rent?” "And most importantly, “Is a tenant over or underpaying?”

## 06 ML_MultipleLinearRegression_YelpResturantStarPrediction

With a dataset of different restaurant features and their Yelp ratings, in this project we use a Multiple Linear Regression model to investigate what factors most affect a restaurant's Yelp rating and predict the Yelp rating for new restaurants

In this project we'll be working with a real dataset provided by Yelp.
